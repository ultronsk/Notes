1) Not be able to use toDF() in spark because import sqlContext.implicits._ is not working

Solution :-
1] Need to get sqlContext as below.

val sqlContext = new org.apache.spark.sql.SQLContext(sc)
import sqlContext.implicits._

2] case class need to be out of method. This is also mentioned in most of the blogs.
